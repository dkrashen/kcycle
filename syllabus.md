Basic Structure
---

- Lectures will be in person in MOOR 212 and simultaneously on Zoom (link available by request)
- For those attending in person, **Masks are required during lecture**
- Grading will be based on attendance and presentations (10-20 minutes long, towards the end of the semester)

An aspirational outline of the course is below (please don't take this too seriously!)
